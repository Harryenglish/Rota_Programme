# We need to get some initial data


# Import the data from a google form and bring it into a data frame
# First take the data, find each employee and their availability
# Then assign shifts based off availability using the schedular
# Check that all contraints are satisfied 
# ^ (people get as many shifts as possible, maximum shifts are occupied, no shifts given twice, only one shift a day)
# Eventually export the rota to a spreadsheet



df = pd.read_excel("rota data export (Responses).xlsx")


# we have imported the data now we need to use a boolean system to know when shifts can be done and who it is that is available

# then we make the schedular !!!
